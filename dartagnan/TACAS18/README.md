# TACAS 2018

This folder contains the scripts to reproduce the reachability and state inclusion experiments from Tables 2 and 3 in the article "Porthos: a Memory Model-aware Verification Tool" submitted to TACAS 2018.

Just run the scripts in bash:
```
sh dartagnan_tso.sh
```
Be sure that the directory including the timeout binary is in your PATH.

The benchmarks translated from .pts format to .litmus format to be run in HERD and in the ../benckmarks folder.

The memory models files for running HERD are in the CAT.
